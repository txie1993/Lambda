## Background

Twitch chat culture is one of the most prominent phenomena on the internet - the simple ability to add emotes through text recognition creates hundreds of reasons to use Twitch chat over another chat client.

Like Twitch itself, I used Ember on the front end to deploy a chat client that can recognize words as emotes. Users are able to select a username upon entering the chatroom, and spam the chat with emotes and copypasta to their heart's desire.

## Technologies and Languages Used

* JavaScript (ES6)
* Ember.js
* CSS3
* SASS


## Implementation Details

I did not know Ember when I began to write this app, and self-taught Ember as I wrote. Lambda is based on Zoltan's Ember Chat App, I consulted Zoltan over Twitter and other members of the Ember Community Slack channel for guidance when I got stuck.

## Future Features

- [ ] Copy/Paste Emotes
- [ ] Migrate to Rails
- [ ] More Emotes
- [ ] Account System
