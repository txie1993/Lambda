## Lambda - An Ember Chat

### Background

Twitch chat culture is one of the most prominent phenomenon on the internet - the simple ability to add emotes through text recognition creates hundreds of reasons to use Twitch chat over another chat client.

Like Twitch itself, I will be using Ember on the front end to deploy a chat client that can recognize words as emotes. Users will be able to select a username upon entering the chatroom, and spam the chat with emotes and copypasta to their heart's desire.

### Functionality & MVP

With this extension, users will be able to:

- [ ] Enter a username upon entering the chatroom
- [ ] Send and receive messages
- [ ] Send and receive emotes embedded in messages by typing the emotes' names
- [ ] Be able to pull up an emote menu that will fill the chat for them, or tab autocomplete emote names.

### Technologies & Technical Challenges

This app will be created with Ember and Pusher, both technologies I have not worked with in the past. I will need to allow myself some time to learn Ember and create some practice projects before I move onto actually creating Lambda.

### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1/2**: Do Ember tutorials. Complete "making your first Ember app" on the Ember website.

**Day 3-7 (weekend)**: Implement a basic chat. Users should be able to choose a username and be able to send messages.

**Day 8**: The app should be able to recognize text as emotes.

**Day 9**: Create an emote modal.

**Day 10-11**: Styling
